This website is dedicated to my loving mother who loves taking pictures of her family! When she hit her dropbox limit upload limit I knew I needed to provide her a more robust photo storage solution! Her photos, plus more are stored here. Now she has a place to store her pictures without the contraints of dropbox and many added features. Currently, photos can be viewed, but future development will allow her to download, share on facebook, and get from facebook! Follow my development on github
