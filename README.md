# Moms-Family-Photos

##Intro
  When my mom filled her dropbox with all of her family pictures, I knew I needed to create someplace to allow her to store and   view all of her photos. Mom's family photos is a ASP.Net MVC site photo gallery site. It allows for the creation of photo     
  galleries, and the uploading of individual photos into the galleries. 
  
  This project has been a great learning expirence for myself. I wanted to strenghten my C# skills, and learn many other skills.   So far this project has taught me so much, and I'm not even close to done with the first iteration. Some of the skills that I   have learned how so far include: 
  
     - Using Entity Framework to talk to a SQL database
     - How the MVC paradigm creates a powerfull, and organized web application 
     - How the Razor view engine can manipulate HTML to create dynamic webpages
     - Basic client side javascript
